# AUV Recruitment

## About Myself

I am Akshai Krishna KP, first-year in CSE batch.
My roll no is CS24B1096.

The above file is rushed out, half baked task for the recruitment of AUV club.
I think i did my best in the alloted time.
I wanted to finish the work without AI therefore took more time to understand the concept.
But still i would say i am a complete noobie in about the topic.
