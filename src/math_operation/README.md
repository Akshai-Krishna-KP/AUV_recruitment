# MATH OPERATION

## Idea
The task is to create a publisher node that send multiple of 2 
and another node recieve and publish the recieved value * 10 and lastly 
another node take the value and add 5.

The task was doable, not simple, because in the YT video i took as refernce he did similar thing using turtlesim.

## Challenges 
The main Three challenges i faced is that i have no CS background.
therefore C is my first and only language and i don't know python.
The next promblem is learning ROS and i think it is understandable but the time constraints make it hard.
and the last challenge was to remember package and to add dependencies.
Same promblem as previous task

## Sources
I mainly used the Youtube vidoes as reference as i wanted to reduce involvement of AI in the work.
But i have used AI for setting dependecies and if i didn't understand any inbuild function 
i used AI to help me in that regard.
