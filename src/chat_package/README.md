# Chat Package

## Idea 
The task is to create a chat package that help to talk between two terminal.
The program will make two node such having different name in two terminal and
connect to same topic. Such that they can talk with each other.
For reference i have attaching a graph :-

## Challenges 
The main Three challenges i faced is that i have no CS background.
therefore C is my first and only language and i don't know python.
The next promblem is learning ROS and i think it is understandable but the time constraints make it hard.
and the last challenge was to remember package and to add dependencies.
But i have tried to learn quickly by reducing sleeping hours.

## Sources
I mainly used the Youtube vidoes as reference as i wanted to reduce involvement of AI in the work.
But i have used AI for setting dependecies and if i didn't understand any inbuild function 
i used AI to help me in that regard.
